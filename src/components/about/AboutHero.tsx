// A magnifying glass sweeps once across the "About us" wordmark while a set of
// isometric desk props flies in from the right and settles.
//
// Every constant below was measured off the reference clip rather than guessed.
// Method: 126 frames pulled through Edge (Playwright's Chromium has no H.264
// decoder and its bundled ffmpeg only demuxes matroska/webm), then read
// numerically — connected-component labelling for the lens ring and each prop,
// per-row run-length scans for the glyph strokes.
//
// Source clip: 1920×500, 11.05s, background #26343C.
