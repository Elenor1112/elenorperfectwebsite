// Work hero, rebuilt from the reference clip (1920x500 landscape strip, 31.21s).
//
// Measured from 210 frames pulled off the decoder. Two things had to be worked
// around to get real frames at all, and both silently produce *plausible but
// wrong* data if missed:
//
//   1. Python's SimpleHTTPRequestHandler ignores Range requests, so the browser
//      could not seek: currentTime stayed pinned at 0 for every assignment and
//      all 60 "frames" came back byte-identical (max pixel diff 0). Serving the
//      file with a 206-capable handler fixed it.
//   2. Frames must be read via canvas drawImage, not element screenshots.
//
// GEOMETRY — five cog badges, cluster measured after it settles:
//   cluster bbox  x 1078..1631, y 30..464  =>  553 x 434  (aspect 1.274)
//   Each gear's hub is a clean white disc, so centres/radii come from the hub
//   rather than the toothed outline. Outer radius is 1.84x the hub radius
//   (measured 1.822 / 1.859 / 1.825 / 1.858 on the four satellites while each
//   was still isolated during the fly-in). Rebuilding the bbox from those radii
//   predicts x 1076..1632, y 29..465 — within 2px of measured, so the model is
//   confirmed rather than assumed.
//
//     gear          centre(px)        hub r    outer r    % of cluster width
//     elenor "e."   1365.5, 178.6     64.1     117.9      21.3
//     Coca-Cola     1180.8, 289.8     56.7     104.3      18.9
//     Duravit       1424.8, 371.1     51.1      94.0      17.0
//     Saint-Gobain  1552.0, 219.8     43.6      80.2       14.5
//     GSK           1217.7,  88.9     32.3      59.4       10.7
//
// ROTATION — every gear has exactly 12 teeth (dominant FFT harmonic of the
// teal coverage sampled on a ring at 1.62x the hub radius; same answer for all
// five). Unwrapping that harmonic's phase across 70 densely-sampled frames and
// least-squares fitting gives:
//
//     elenor       -35.064 deg/s     residual RMS 0.385 deg
//     Coca-Cola    +35.072 deg/s     residual RMS 0.380 deg
//     Duravit      +35.062 deg/s     residual RMS 0.377 deg
//     Saint-Gobain +35.072 deg/s     residual RMS 0.370 deg
//     GSK          +35.065 deg/s     residual RMS 0.383 deg
//
// So: one speed, 35.07 deg/s = 10.27s per revolution, centre gear one way and
// all four satellites the other. The residuals are the headline number — 0.38
// deg of scatter over 2.5s says the motion is EXACTLY linear, with no easing,
// no wobble, and no speed ramp anywhere in the loop.
//
// The speed ratio is +-1.000 despite radii spanning 59..118px, which is NOT
// what real meshed gears do (a true gear train scales angular speed by the
// inverse radius ratio, so the small GSK cog would spin ~2x the "e"). The
// source was authored as one flat counter-rotation, and the four satellites
// share a single tooth phase (4.83/4.84/4.83/4.90 deg at t=3.0s) confirming
// they are one rigid group. Reproducing the "physical" version instead would
// visibly disagree with the clip, so this matches the clip.
//
// WHAT ACTUALLY SPINS — the rings, not the logos. Every client mark stays
// upright through the whole loop: the principal axis of the dark logo ink
// inside each hub holds constant (Coca-Cola 178.95 -> 178.86 deg, Duravit
// 179.09 flat, Saint-Gobain 175.59 -> 175.55, the "e" 143.32 -> 143.34) across
// 2.5s in which the teeth advance 87 deg. Since the artwork bakes ring and logo
// into a single bitmap, each gear renders twice with complementary radial
// masks — see the clip construction in the JSX below.
//
// INTRO — the "e" is present from frame 0 and never moves. Each satellite
// slides in from its own direction and decelerates into place; radius is
// constant throughout, so it is a translate, not a scale-up:
//
//     gear          enters at   settles   duration   travel(px)   distance
//     Coca-Cola       0.353s     0.969s    0.616s    +53, -102     115.3
//     GSK             0.793s     1.498s    0.705s    +66,  +63      90.5

// 0.309s window, so it is the weakest fit of the four). power2.5 is the
// consensus, which is what the entrance uses.
//
// After 1.5s nothing translates again: the cluster bbox is pixel-identical for
