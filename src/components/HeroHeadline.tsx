// HERO HEADLINE — recreated frame-for-frame from D:\Web\Comp-1.mp4
//
// Every number below was MEASURED off the reference, not designed. Frames were
// captured through Edge (98 presented frames over the 3.96 s clip) and the two
// text layers separated from the background by colour signature, then their
// bounding boxes tracked per frame. See REF/LAYOUT/TIMING for what came out.
//
// TWO DIFFERENT MECHANISMS, because the reference uses two:
//
//  1. SCRIPT WORDS ("Where", "Meets") are WRITTEN ON. Cropping the reveal shows
//     letters emerging as growing pen strokes, all letters advancing in
//     parallel. Crucially the ink is at FULL brightness in its first visible
//     frame (peak 255 from frame one) while only the lit AREA grows — so this
//     is a reveal, never a fade. Both words share one normalised progress curve
//     (.022 .073 .147 .240 .343 … at matching offsets); they are the same
//     animation, delayed.
//
//  2. ORBITRON WORDS are WIPED by a hard horizontal edge, fully lit behind it —
//     "INNOVATION" bottom→top, "QUALITY." top→bottom. Opposite directions, and
//     that opposition is the whole character of the lockup.
//
// No fades, no scaling, no rotation, no translation: every word's bounding box
// is static across the entire clip. No glow either — the measured edge ramp is
// 22→74→226 over ~2 px, i.e. plain antialiasing.

 * height. That empty margin is an artefact of where the lockup happened to sit
 * in the source video, not part of the composition, and rendering the full
 * frame spends most of the hero's width on transparent padding.
 *
 * Cropping the viewBox to the ink (plus a small margin so the script swashes and
 * the cyan pulse never clip) makes the lockup fill its container. Every
 * coordinate above stays in REF space and is untouched — only the window onto
 * them moves — so the Meets/INNOVATION/QUALITY interlock is preserved exactly.
 *
 * The LEFT edge takes no pad: the headline is left-aligned against the eyebrow
 * and sub-copy, and any pad there becomes a transparent gap that pushes the ink

 * `HEADLINE_INK_SPAN` is the fraction of that box actually covered by ink,
 * measured left edge of "Where" (x=389, flush with VIEW.x) to right edge of
 * "QUALITY." (x=817) — QUALITY. being the widest word's right edge, and
 * therefore the lockup's.
 *
