// Services hero, rebuilt from the reference clip (1080x1920 portrait, 7.41s).
//
// Measured from 160 frames captured off the decoder. (Seeking by currentTime
// returns frame 0 forever on this file, so the frames had to be pulled during
// real playback via requestVideoFrameCallback.)
//
// GEOMETRY — nine icons on a ring around a centred label:
//   content box  x 116..973, y 761..1609  =>  858 x 848, centre (544, 1185)
//   ring radius  mean 385px across all nine  =  45% of the box
//   angular gaps 38.6 36.2 39.3 40.1 41.7 41.5 42.1 40.9  =>  mean 40.0deg,
//                which is exactly 360/9, so the ring is evenly divided.
//
// MOTION — the ring does NOT spin. That was the first hypothesis and the
// numbers killed it: each icon's radius holds to a std of ~15px, and the
// unwrapped angle oscillates +/-15deg with *zero net drift* over the full
// 7.4s. What actually moves is a spotlight: exactly one icon is enlarged at
// any moment, advancing clockwise from the top, ~0.95s per step.
//
// Highlight magnitude, read off slot 2 (top fingerprint — the only icon with
// no neighbour bleed in its sample window):
//   at rest      bbox 105 x 105   mean luma 170   area ~3775
//   highlighted  bbox 135 x 117   mean luma 223   area ~8434
//   => scale 135/105 = 1.29x, and the area ratio 2.23 ~= 1.29^2 confirms it
//      is a real scale rather than a brightness-only pulse.
//   => opacity tracks luma 170 -> 223, i.e. ~0.62 -> 1.0
//   => envelope: rise ~0.18s, hold ~0.45s, decay ~0.35s
//
// The centre label swaps in step with the spotlight. Its transition is a
// vertical slide + crossfade, not a plain fade: the text band grows from 43px
// (one settled line) to as much as 105px mid-transition, because the outgoing
// line is still leaving upward while the incoming one is still arriving from
// below. Both are on screen at once.
//
// The service links are real server-rendered markup that GSAP only ever
// transforms, so crawlers and no-JS visitors still get a crawlable link to all
// nine services.
//
// DEVIATION FROM THE CLIP (requested): the reference ring is static and only
// the spotlight travels. Here the whole ring also turns continuously — one
// unbroken rotation with no lap boundary to restart on. Each icon is
// counter-rotated by the same angle so the artwork stays upright instead of
// tumbling with the carrier.

          {/* ── Animated ring ──
              A square stage so every slot keeps the polar position measured
              off the clip at any width. It runs wider than the 34rem the ring
              used to sit in because the icons are ART_SCALE bigger and the
              radius is pushed out to clear the label — at the old width the
              outermost artwork would sit on the stage edge.

              The slot boxes are percentages of this stage, and at RADIUS_PCT
              52 the outermost artwork reaches ~29% of the stage width past its
              own box on every side, so the stage can never be full-bleed or the
              orbit is cut off by the section.

              Sizing is now column-relative rather than the old `68vw`: in the
              two-column layout this box only owns the right column, so a
              viewport-width cap would overflow it — at md the column is already
              narrower than 68vw. It takes STAGE_PCT of the column so that the
              stage plus its overhang exactly fills the column and no artwork is
              drawn over the copy beside it.

              The overhang is reserved by making this box taller than it is
              wide (aspect-ratio below) and letting the square ring sit inside
              it. Padding/margin percentages would not work: they resolve
              against the PARENT's width, which stops tracking the stage as
              soon as the max-w ceiling takes over. An aspect-ratio is defined
              by this element's own width, so the reserved space scales with the
              ring at every breakpoint. */}
          {/* Below md the grid is stacked, so this column is the full container
              and there is no copy beside the ring for the overhang to land on —
              it can spill into the page gutters as it always did, and holding it
              to STAGE_PCT there would only shrink the artwork for no reason. The
              STAGE_PCT reserve is therefore applied from md up, where the ring
              actually has a neighbour. */}

                position and turns as one, which is what sweeps the icons
                around the circular path.

                It has to be an explicit centred SQUARE, not inset-0: the outer
                box is deliberately taller than it is wide to reserve the
                overhang, and every slot position is a percentage of a square.
                Stretching the carrier to a non-square parent would turn the

                        is grown back out around it to cancel this file's
                        transparent padding, then divided by the same pad so the
                        artwork still renders at `art` and only the hit area
                        grew. Sizing the link to the padded canvas instead would
                        leave the widest icons (the play triangle carries 4.7x
                        its own art in padding) with hit targets that overlap
                        their neighbours' and swallow their clicks.

                        The scale is applied to the axis the canvas is square
                        against — the box is now the artwork's aspect, so
                        letting object-contain fit a square canvas into it would
                        letterbox the art and shrink it on the short axis.

                        pointer-events-none is load-bearing, not tidiness. The
                        image is deliberately grown past its own link to cancel
                        the file's transparent padding, so it overflows onto the
                        neighbouring slots — the play triangle renders 491x464
                        around 106x122 of link. Left hittable, that transparent
                        rectangle sat on top of its neighbours and ate their
                        pointer events: it was covering 98% of the AI cluster,
                        which is what made that icon feel like it was all dead
                        spots. The <a> is sized to the artwork and is the honest
                        target, so the art itself never needs to be hittable. */}
